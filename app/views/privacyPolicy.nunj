            Through the Services, Faajii provides a simple and quick means for registered users who are event Organizers, planners and
            charitable organizations (“Organizers”) to create event registration, speaker profile, Organizer profile, and other webpages

            registrations (or issue free registrations), solicit donations and sell merchandise related to those events to users who wish
            to make purchases, registrations or donations from or to such events (including to free events) (“Attendees”). We refer to Organizers,

        </p>
        <h3>Our Privacy Statement.</h3>
        <p><b>Application.</b></p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that can be associated with or
            which relates to a person and/or could be used to identify a person (“Personal Data”) that is collected
            from Users on or through the Services. "Non-Personal Data" as used in this Privacy Policy is therefore any
            information that does not relate to a person and/or cannot be used to identify a person. We take the privacy of
            your Personal Data seriously. Because of that, we have created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy
            as it includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other information. When you interact with the
            Services, we may also collect Non-Personal Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy Policy on our
            collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage/retention of Personal Data do not apply to Non-Personal Data.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Data That We Collect.</h3>
        <p>When you use or interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data, as further described below:</p>
        <p><b>All Users.</b></p>
        <p>
            Information you provide to us: For all Users we collect Personal Data when you voluntarily provide such information
            to the Services, such as when you register for access to the Services, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our
            surveys or browse or use certain parts of the Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation
            your name, address, email address and other information that enables Users to be personally identified. Information we
            automatically collect: We also automatically collect certain technical data that is sent to us from the computer,
            mobile device and/or browser through which you access the Services (“Automatic Data”). Automatic Data, includes without

            Protocol (IP) address) characteristics about your access device and/or browser, statistics on your activities on the Services,
            information about how you came to the Services and data collected through Cookies, Local Shared Objects,
            Web Storage and other similar technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you register for the Services or otherwise submit Personal Data to us, we may associate other Non-Personal Data
            (including Non-Personal Data we collect from third parties) with your Personal Data. At such instance, we will treat
            any such combined data as Personal Data until such time as it can no longer be associated with you or used to identify you.
        </p>
        <p><b>Organizers.</b></p>

            As an Organizer we will collect additional Personal Data from you. Information you provide to us: In some cases,
            we may collect your credit card information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.),
            some of which may constitute Personal Data, to secure certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment processing
            services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks)
            as necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number).
            Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive Personal Data from third party sources, such as third
            party websites, your bank, our payment processing partners and credit reporting agencies.

        <p><b>Attendees.</b></p>
        <p>As an Attendee we will collect additional Personal Data from you. </p>

            (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data.
            In addition, Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually any information from Attendees in
            connection with registration for an Organizer’s event listed on the Services. If an Attendee voluntarily
            provides that information in connection with registration for an event or otherwise, it will be available to us
            and will be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, such information will be delivered to
            the Organizer of the applicable event in accordance with “How We Disclose and Transfer Your Personal Data: Organizers” below.
        </p>
        <p>

            such as Organizers, other Attendees, social media or other third party integrations, your credit card issuing bank,
            our payment processing partners or other third parties.

        </p>
        <h3>Cookies, Local Shared Objects, Web Storage And Similar Technologies.</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies and similar technologies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier.
            Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.
            Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all
            cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may
            not be able to use some portions of our Site.
        </p>
        <h3>Your Choices.</h3>
        <p>
            You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data:
        </p>
        <p><b>Limit the Personal Data You Provide..</b></p>
        <p>
            You can browse theServices without providing any Personal Data (other than Automatic Data to the extent it is considered Personal
            Data under applicable laws) or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit
            the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain functionality of the Services. For instance, in order to open an account,
            or buy or sell tickets, your name and email address will be required.
        </p>
        <p><b>Opt Out from Electronic Communications.</b></p>
        <p>(a) Faajii Marketing Communications.</p>
        <p>
            Where it is in accordance with your marketing preferences, Faajii may send you electronic communications marketing
            or advertising the Services themselves or events on the Services, to the extent you have registered for the Services or purchased a
            ticket and/or registration to an event listed on the Services.
        </p>
        <p>(b) Organizer Initiated Communications.</p>
        <p>
            Organizers may use our email tools to send electronic communications to those on their email subscription lists, including
            Attendees who have registered for their events on the Services in the past. Although these electronic communications are sent
            through our system, Faajii does not determine the content or the recipients of these electronic communications. Organizers are
            required to use our email tools only in accordance with all applicable laws. Faajii provides an “Unsubscribe” link on each of these
            emails, which allows recipients to “opt out” of electronic communications from the particular Organizer.
        </p>
        <p>(c) Social Notifications.</p>
        <p>
            If you connect your Facebook account or sign up for other social media integrations whose product features include social
            notifications (i.e., updates on what your friends are doing on the Services), you will receive these social notifications.
            You can manage these social notifications by toggling your social settings to private or disconnecting such integration.
        </p>
        <p>(d) Transactional or Responsive Communications.</p>
        <p>
            Certain electronic communications from Faajii are responsive to your requests.
            For instance, if you are an Attendee, we must email you your ticket or registration when you purchase such ticket or registration.
            As a further example, if you email our customer support department, we will return your email. Notwithstanding any unsubscribe
            election that you have made, you will still receive these emails. You can stop receiving these types of emails only by contacting
            us. By electing to stop receiving all electronic communications from us or through our system you will no longer receive any
            updates on events you have created (including pay-out issues) or on events you are registered to attend (including emails with
            your tickets). We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Services, are not currently registered
            for an event, are not currently organizing an event and will have no need to receive further communications from us or through
            our system.
        </p>
        <p>(e) Retention.</p>
        <p>
            It may take up to forty-eight (48) hours for us to process an unsubscribe request. Even after you opt
            out of all electronic communications, we will retain your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will
            no longer use it to contact you. However, Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy
            may still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use our system to
            do so.
        </p>
        <p>Do Not Track.</p>
        <p>
            We currently do not participate in any “Do Not Track” frameworks that would allow us to respond to
            signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your Personal Data.
        </p>
        <h3>Exclusions.</h3>
        <p><b>Personal Data Provided to Others.</b></p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data that you provide to another User or visitor through the Services or
            through any other means, including to Organizers on event pages or information posted by you to any public areas of the Services.
        </p>
        <p><b>Third Party Links.</b></p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us
            (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the
            Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for
            information on their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p><b>Aggregated Personal Data.</b></p>
        <p>
            In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we often conduct research on our customer demographics,
            interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed
            on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and we therefore consider and treat this data
            as Non-Personal Data.
        </p>

        <h3>Children.</h3>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of thirteen (13),
            please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
