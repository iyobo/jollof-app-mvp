        <h2>3. Fees, Charges, and Payment methods</h2>
        <p><b>3.1. Overview.</b></p>
        <p>
            Faajii charges a per-ticket or per-Item fee (as applicable) for our Services. Through the Faajii payment processor, Faajii
            charges a per-ticket or per-Item processing fee for ticket or Item sales and for Item refunds (but we do not provide refunds for
            any Item that is Merchandise). Faajii's per-ticket or per-Item fee for ticket and Item sales and per-ticket and per-Item refund
            processing fee for ticket or Item refunds, together with any other payment referred to as a Fee in these Terms, are collectively
            referred to as "Fees". The Organizer determines whether the applicable Fees will be shown as fees or absorbed into the price of
            any Item. The Organizer is responsible to pay us the Fees (which Fees may be included in the price of any Item) and in addition,
            we are entitled to deduct any Fees from any of the Organizer's booking or sales revenue as provided in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Fees and any other monies contemplated by these Terms are payable in Canadian Dollars, or in any foreign currency accepted by
            Faajii for Events, Items or Fees in another country or jurisdiction as shown on our Site.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.2. Using Faajii payment processor.</b></p>
        <p>
            The Faajii payment processor provides for direct payment processing by Faajii of payments by Patrons for purchases of tickets or
            other Items (including any amount associated with the payments) from registered Organizers. Through the Faajii payment processor,
            Organizers are assessed a processing Fee payable to Faajii in an amount equal to 3% of the discounted face value of each ticket or
            other Item sold, plus an additional $1.00 per ticket or Item sold. Such Fees are payable to Faajii on the date that the associated
            payment is collected through the Faajii payment processor or otherwise paid by the Patron. Faajii agrees with registered Organizers
            that, through the Faajii payment processor: (i) Faajii will collect the payments for the tickets or other Items (including any amount
            associated with the payments) on behalf of the Organizer from the Patron; (ii) Faajii will deduct from all amounts held on the
            Organizer's behalf, applicable Fees due to Faajii as and when such Fees become due and any other amount then due to Faajii for any
            reason, and following such deduction, will pay the balance to the Organizer either via cheque delivered by mail at the address that
            the Organizer provides to us through the Site, or, for Organizers utilizing the ACH/EFT Direct Deposit function, by direct deposit
            into the account authorized by the Organizer. The Organizer represents and warrants to Faajii that the mailing address and/or chequing
            account information provided to us is accurate and that the Organizer will update this information as necessary to maintain its
            accuracy; and (iii) Faajii will use commercially reasonable efforts to submit payment for the balance due to the Organizer under
            clause (ii) above in respect of an Event within seven (7) business days after the date for the completion of the Event; provided that,
            Faajii reserves the right to withhold funds at any time as Faajii in its sole discretion determines to be necessary for the processing
            and settlement of all returns, disputed charges, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, chargebacks, expected chargebacks and
            other discrepancies. Without limiting Faajii's right to withhold any funds for such period as it determines is necessary, this withholding
            will generally amount to approximately 10% of all sales, for possible refund purposes, to be returned after seven to 14 days after
            the Event. Faajii's obligation to pay any amount to the Organizer is subject to Sections 3.3 to 3.7 inclusive and Section 6 of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.3. Refunds.</b></p>
        <p>
            It is the Organizer's responsibility to communicate its refund policy to Patrons. In the event of cancelled or postponed Events,
            the Organizer's refund policy will be superseded by Faajii's refund policy set forth in Section (3.3)(ii) of these Terms below. The
            Organizer will ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms and conditions of these Terms, the payment and refund
            processes included in the Services, and all applicable legal, regulatory and other governmental requirements. All communications
            or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and the Patron, and Faajii will not be liable to the Organizer or to any
            Patron for any decision to issue or not issue refunds. Faajii will not be obligated or liable to any Patron in connection with
            any use of, or failure to use, the refund policy set forth in Section (3.3)(ii) of these Terms below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, Faajii will not provide refunds of any amount on account of Fees,
            except in its discretion pursuant to Section 3.3(iii) of these Terms below If an Organizer desires to issue a refund for Fees to Patrons,
            or if an Organizer is required to issue a refund for Fees pursuant to Section 3.3(ii) of these Terms below, it is the Organizer's sole
            responsibility to issue the payment on account of Fees directly to its Patrons or submit payment to Faajii of the amount on account of Fees
            prior to Faajii refunding that amount to such Patrons. Faajii charges a per-ticket or per-Item refund Fee for all refunds processed through
            our payment processor or otherwise hereunder equal to 3% of the original, non-discounted price of the applicable ticket or other Item
            (the Refund Fee).
        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, Faajii will not provide refunds of any Item which is Merchandise.
        </p>
        <p>
            i.	Individual Refunds. If a Patron desires to request a refund (other than a refund for a Cancellation (as defined below)), the
            Patron must request the refund from the Organizer. If the Organizer desires to fulfill the request, the Organizer may utilize the
            Services or contact Faajii to process the refund, in which case the Refund Fee will apply. Faajii agrees with the Organizer that it
            will use commercially reasonable efforts to process refunds issued and requested to be issued by such Organizer in a timely manner
            after such Organizer authorizes the issuance of the refunds and provides to Faajii sufficient amounts, in immediately available
            funds (including amounts on account of Fees due or paid to Faajii), to process the refunds. Faajii will not provide individual
            refunds which have not been authorized and funded by the Organizer in accordance with this Section and will not refund Fees due
            or paid to Faajii.
        </p>
        <p>
            ii.	Cancelled or Rescheduled Events. No payments will be made to an Organizer from Faajii with respect to any Item or Event that is
            cancelled, removed, discontinued, or otherwise not proceeding (or for which the Organizer otherwise authorizes a refund)
            (a Cancellation). In the event of a Cancellation, Faajii and the Organizer agree that Faajii will invoice the Organizer for
            an additional amount equal to all Fees (including the Refund Fee) due or paid to Faajii for such Items or Events (the Fee Amount),
            which invoice shall be due seven (7) days from the invoice date. Faajii agrees with the Organizer that it will thereafter process
            refunds to Patrons as follows: (a) upon payment of the Fee Amount in full and provided the Organizer's balance held by Faajii
            following such payment (after deduction by Faajii of any amounts then owing to it by the Organizer) is available and sufficient
            to fund a full refund to Patrons, Faajii will, as soon as practicable, issue a full refund to Patrons; (b) upon payment of the
            Fee Amount in full but the Organizer's balance held by Faajii following such payment (after deduction by Faajii of any amounts
            then owing to it by the Organizer) is not sufficient to fund a full refund to Patrons, Faajii will, as soon as practicable,
            issue a partial refund to Patrons to the extent the Organizer's balance (net of deductions) is available to fund such partial
            refund; and (c) if the Organizer fails to pay the Fee Amount to Faajii when due, Faajii will, as soon as practicable (after
            deduction by Faajii of any amounts then owing to it by the Organizer), issue a partial refund to Patrons to the extent the
            Organizer's balance (net of deductions) is available to fund such partial refund, and in each case Faajii will have no further
            liability or obligation to the Organizer or any Patron with respect to any such refund or any Cancellation. In no event will Faajii
            be obligated to utilize its own funds to fund any refund. If an Event is rescheduled, Faajii will use its sole discretion to
            determine whether it is considered a Cancellation and therefore subject to the refund policy described in this Section.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            iii.	Notwithstanding Sections 3.3(i) and 3.3(ii), Organizers acknowledge and agree that, to protect its reputation and the
            integrity of the Site, Faajii will have the right (but not the obligation) to force or provide a refund to Patrons of any or all
            amounts paid for tickets or other Items (other than Merchandise) at any time for any reason or no reason, including, but not
            limited to, if Faajii receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by Faajii in its sole discretion) of Patrons
            with respect to an Event or Items, or Faajii determines in its sole discretion that the Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent
            activity with respect to, or made any misrepresentations to, any Patron or Faajii in respect of any Item or Event. Such refund may
            include an amount on account of Fees as determined by Faajii in its discretion. Faajii will have no liability whatsoever to an
            Organizer in connection with or arising from any such decision to force or provide refunds, and the Organizer will promptly
            reimburse Faajii for any amount refunded by Faajii on account of Fees and promptly pay to Faajii the Refund Fee. Faajii will have
            no liability whatsoever to any Patron in connection with any decision to, or not to, for or provide refunds under this Section.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.4 Credit card chargebacks.</b></p>
        <p>
            Any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Patron for any reason with respect to an Item or Event will be charged back to the
            Organizer. Faajii in its sole discretion will either (i) deduct such costs from such Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for
            that particular Event or for any other Event that such Organizer lists through the Services; or (ii) send an invoice to such
            Organizer for such costs to the extent such balance is insufficient to cover such costs. If payment for such invoice is not
            received by Faajii within thirty (30) days after the invoice date, Faajii reserves the right, at Faajii's sole discretion, to
            terminate these Terms as between Faajii and such Organizer. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between
            the Organizer and Patron, and Faajii will not be responsible or liable in any way to Organizers or Patrons for credit card
            chargebacks.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.3. Confirmation.</b></p>
        <p>
            Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual purchaser, Faajii generates a confirmation message and issues a
            unique confirmation number. Each Organizer agrees, with respect to its Events, to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all
            ticketing and other commitments that have been confirmed by Faajii through the Services with respect to any such Event (and not
            returned or voided), and it is such Organizer's responsibility to verify the applicable Patron's membership status, confirmation
            number and/or any restrictions prior to the any admission or delivery. If we learn that the Organizer is not honoring our
            commitments, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate these Terms as between Faajii and such Organizer.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.6. Over-sale charges.</b></p>
        <p>
            Organizer is solely responsible for setting the number of Admission Items available for purchase for each event. Organizer will
            manually enter ticket types, ticket quantities and ticket prices on the Faajii client backend for each individual Event. Organizer
            represents, warrants and covenants that the number of tickets or other Admission Items for sale with respect to each Event is
            within the legal fire regulations and venue capacity limitations as set forth by the applicable municipal, provincial or federal
            authority or by applicable law. If over sales of tickets or other Admission Items occur (for example, selling tickets in excess of
            the venue capacity), Organizer agrees that it will refund the full ticket or other Admission Item price, plus any and all related
            Service Fees, to the purchaser holding any such affected and unused tickets or other Admission Items pursuant to Section 3.6.
            Organizer further agrees that Organizer will pay Faajii for the full refunded Service Fees for such Tickets that are refunded under
            this Section 3.6. If the Organizer requests Faajii to process the refund, the refund will be processed by Faajii in accordance
            with Section 3.3(i).
        </p>
        <p><b>3.7. Overdue amounts.</b></p>
        <p>
            In the event the Organizer does not pay to Faajii any amount required to paid by it under these Terms on the date such amount is
            due (or if no due date is expressed, upon demand by Faajii), Faajii will be entitled to recover from the Organizer, in addition
            to any amounts otherwise owing, its reasonable costs of collection, including, but not limited to, collection agency fees, reasonable
            attorneys' fees, and court costs. Any amounts not paid by the Organizer to Faajii when due shall thereafter bear interest, both
            before and after judgment, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate of the Royal Bank of Canada, Main Branch, Calgary, AB.,
            plus 3%. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms, Faajii may set off any funds it holds on behalf of Organizer against
            any amounts due to Faajii, under these Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Taxes; Withholding</h2>
        <p>
            The Organizer is responsible for (and will indemnify and hold harmless Faajii from and against) all taxes or other governmental
            charges in connection with the provision of the Services including, but not limited to, the provision of the actual Services, any sales
            of any Item or otherwise in connection with any Event (excepting taxes based on Faajii's net income) including, but not limited to,
            any GST, PST, HST or amusement tax. It is the Organizer's responsibility to know if any applicable laws apply to it or the Event or
            any purchase or sale in respect thereof and to adjust the applicable price accordingly to account for payment of these taxes or other
            governmental charges. An Organizer may present its prices as inclusive or exclusive of such taxes or other governmental charges in
            accordance with applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Faajii determines that it is required to collect, remit or pay any such taxes or other charges in connection with the provision of
            the Services including, but not limited to, the actual provision of the Services or any sales of any Item or in connection with any
            Event, it may deduct such amounts from any amount payable to the Organizer under these Terms or invoice the Organizer for such taxes
            or other charges, which invoice will be payable thirty (30) days after the invoice date. Faajii reserves the right to withhold the
            payment of any amounts payable to the Organizer hereunder if Faajii suspects or determines that such amounts have been generated in
            (i) a fraudulent manner or in a manner involving misrepresentation, (ii) breach of these Terms, or (iii) violation of any federal,
            provincial, or local laws, or any applicable foreign laws.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Event restrictions</h2>
        <p>When submitting Items or Events to Faajii to be listed through our Services, it is the Organizer's responsibility to provide to us any
            restrictions associated with any such Item or Event. Any Item or Event that requires a restriction for admission or usage,
            including, but not limited to, age, school or organizational affiliation, or other characteristics or requirements, must be
            clearly stated by the Organizer upon submission to us. The Organizer shall ensure that such restriction is lawful and does not
            violate any federal, provincial, or local laws, or any applicable foreign laws, prior to submitting the Item or Event to us.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Access</h2>
        <p>
            You understand and agree that the Site and the Services may, at times, be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, but not
            limited to: (i) equipment or communications malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance, repairs, or administrative reviews which we
            may undertake from time-to-time; or (iii) causes beyond our reasonable control or which are not reasonably foreseeable by us, such
            as acts of government, the malicious or criminal acts of third parties or the provision of necessary infrastructure to us including,
            but not limited to, internet services. Faajii will not be liable to any Organizer or any Patron for any damages, losses, liabilities,
            costs or expenses arising in connection with the Site or the Services being inaccessible or inoperable.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Representations, warranties and covenants</h2>
        <p>
            Each Organizer represents, warrants covenants the following on a continuous basis: (i) it is an organizer, producer, promoter, presenter,
            owner or manager of each Event in respect of which it uses the Services; (ii) it has the authority and right to offer, sell, and honor
            the tickets and other Items listed on our Site as well as to provide lawful admission to any Event relating to any such tickets or other

            publicity, whether by statute or common law, and does not constitute a violation of any federal, provincial, or local laws or any
            applicable foreign laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Patron and Organizer acknowledges and agrees that Faajii will not be responsible for any Liability or Claim (as such terms are defined
            in these Terms below) arising in respect of any Merchandise offered or sold through the Services (any of the foregoing, a Merchandise
            Liability or Claim) including any failure of Organizer to ship or deliver, or receive or accept any return of, Merchandise, any express or
            implied condition or warranty relating to any Merchandise including pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act (Alberta) or otherwise, any term
            or condition of any sale agreement, or agreement to sell, Merchandise, and the manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale or use of
            Merchandise. Organizer will be responsible to ship and deliver, and accept all returns of, Merchandise and to communicate with Patrons
            directly regarding any Merchandise Liability or Claim. Each Organizer agrees that it will indemnify and save Faajii harmless from
            and against, any Merchandise Liability or Claim arising in respect of any Merchandise offered or sold in respect of such Organizer's
            Events or otherwise by such Organizer.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Misrepresentation</h2>
        <p>All Items and Events must be accurately and truthfully described by the Organizer when it submits such Items and Events to Faajii to be
            posted on the Site. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that an Organizer has misrepresented any Item or Event to us or any Patron,
            or engaged in any fraudulent activity with respect to any Item or Event, we may remove any such Items or Events and may issue a refund
            based on our Terms, and, in addition, we may terminate these Terms as between us and such Organizer.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Technical support</h2>
        <p>
            Faajii agrees with each Organizer that it will provide technical and other customer support to such Organizer by which it can obtain

        <h2>10. Confidentiality and Non-disclosure</h2>
        <p>Each Organizer understands and acknowledges that Faajii is the owner of valuable trade secrets and confidential, non-public, and
            proprietary information (collectively "Confidential Information") and acknowledges that the services which we perform involve the
            furnishing of Confidential Information to Organizers including, but not limited to: (i) customer names, mailing addresses, and other
            personally-identifiable information; (ii) sales; (iii) market demographics; (iv) pricing; and (v) business strategy, and that the
            goodwill and competitive position of Faajii depend, in part, upon such Organizer keeping such Confidential Information confidential
            and not using such Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with planning and holding Events and sales
            of related Items (the Permitted Purpose). Each Organizer agrees to use its best efforts to protect our Confidential Information
            and to implement security measures to keep such Confidential Information confidential, to use such Confidential Information only
            for the Permitted Purpose and for no other purpose, and to not provide such Confidential Information to any individual or other
            person except to its directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information
            for the Permitted Purpose. Except pursuant to court order or our prior written consent (which consent may be unreasonably withheld),
            each Organizer agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its representatives who receive Confidential Information to not,
            disclose, distribute, sell, license, transmit, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any other party or permit or cause
            any unauthorized party to disclose, examine, and/or reproduce any reports, documents, transmissions, or data containing
            Confidential Information prepared or owned by us. If an Organizer is requested or required to disclose Confidential Information
            pursuant to legal proceedings, it will promptly notify us so that we may prepare a response to such legal proceedings and such
            Organizer will cooperate with our efforts to obtain information.</p>
        <h2>11. Non-solicitation</h2>
        <p>Each Organizer agrees that it will not solicit or contact for the purpose of soliciting, or assist anyone else in soliciting or
            contacting for the purpose of soliciting, via e-mail or through other means, any of our customers (including, but not limited to,
            any Patron or Organizer such first Organizer interacts with through the Site or the Services) in order to purchase, buy, acquire,
            or obtain any other product, service, or other solicitation, or for the purpose of terminating, altering, or in any way modifying
            our customers' relationships with us.</p>
        <h2>12. Promotion</h2>
        <p>Each Organizer will use reasonable efforts to create, produce, and distribute marketing and promotional materials, and/or otherwise

        <p><b>(a) Termination by Faajii</b></p>
        <p>
            As between Faajii and any User, Faajii may terminate these Terms at any time on notice to such User (a) due to such User's violation
            or breach of these Terms; (b) due to such User's misuse or abuse of the Services (including, but not limited to, the use of any
            objectionable or unlawful content in Faajii' sole discretion); or (c) if allowing such User to use, or continue to use, the

        <p><b>(b) Termination on notice</b></p>
        <p>

            limited to, in the case of termination between Faajii and an Organizer, removing all of Events and Items of such Organizer

            any obligation of Faajii to an Organizer to pay any amounts then owing to such Organizer (net of Fees) in respect of sales of
            tickets or other Items pursuant to these Terms. No termination of these Terms in respect of a User, will require notice to any
            other User. In the event these Terms terminate between Faajii and any User, these Terms will continue in full force and
            effect between Faajii and all other Users.
        </p>
        <p><b>(d) Survival</b></p>
        <p>
            All terms and conditions of these Terms which by their nature should survive any termination of these Terms between Faajii and any

            liability, non-solicitation obligations, provisions relating to governing law and attornment to jurisdiction, and provisions

        <p><b>17.1. Privacy policy</b></p>
        <p>
            All information provided by Users or collected by Faajii in connection with the Services is governed by Faajii's Privacy Policy, a
            copy of which is published on our website at www.Faajii.com/privacy-policy . As noted in Section 3 of these Terms, Faajii's Privacy
            Policy is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Faajii strongly recommends that you review the Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p><b>17.2.Personal data</b></p>
        <p>
            As set out in the Privacy Policy, Faajii collects Personal Data (as defined in the Privacy Policy) pertaining to customers and
            purchasers of Items for the purpose of carrying out the Services, including marketing or promotion of other events or services
            that may be of interest to Users.
            Users acknowledge that Organizers may receive Personal Data related to their Events, from Faajii through the provision and use
            of the Services, and that Faajii will not be liable for the use of Personal Data by Organizers.
            Each Organizer agrees that it shall comply at all times with all applicable privacy laws, and, without limiting the foregoing, shall:<br/>
            a.	only collect, use and disclose Personal Data as necessary to meet its duties and obligations pursuant to this Agreement and for
            purposes authorized by applicable privacy laws;<br/>
            b.	make reasonable efforts to keep all Personal Data strictly confidential;<br/>

            d.	respond to requests to access, amend or correct Personal Data as soon as is reasonably practicable with consideration to the
            statutory time requirements referenced in applicable privacy laws;<br/>
            e.	immediately report any improper use or disclosure of Personal Data to Faajii and any applicable statutory or regulatory authority;<br/>
            f.	have and maintain a privacy policy that complies with all applicable privacy laws;<br/>

            that apply to Organizer as described in this Section; and<br/>
            h.	absent consent from affected individuals, immediately return to destroy all Personal Data related to this Agreement within
            five (5) Business Days of the termination of this Agreement and retain no such Personal Data in any form whatsoever.
            Each Organizer further acknowledges and agrees that, upon a request of a given Patron or as otherwise permitted this Agreement,
            Faajii is authorized at its discretion to delete or anonymize the Personal Data of a requesting Patron from the Services, at which
            time it will no longer be available to Organizer through the Services or will no longer be linked to an identifiable Patron
        </p>
        <p><b>17.3. Payment data</b></p>
        <p>
            Faajii will not share any Payment Data with an Organizer. Payment Data means any full credit card number or other full payment
            account number and the related expiration date and security code entered by a Patron on the Services in order to purchase an Item
            related to Events or any other comparable transaction, so long as such information is entered in the fields under Payment on the
            order payment page. Note that if a Patron enters such information in other areas of the Services or otherwise provides it to another
            entity, it may not be encrypted and may be automatically shared with the applicable Organizer. As such, Patrons should ensure they
            enter such information only under Payment on the order payment page.

            emails were gathered and which was disclosed to recipients at the time of gathering;<br/>
            b.	your use of the Email/Texting Tools is in compliance with all applicable local, state, provincial, federal and other laws,

            and regulations, including those relating to spam and email;<br/>

            g.	you will not email or text any person that you know or have reason to know has opted out of receiving emails or texts from you.
            If you fail to abide by any of the foregoing, if your use of the Email/Texting Tools results in bounce rates, complaint rates
            or unsubscribe requests in excess of industry standards or if your emails or texts are found to cause disruption to the Services,
            Faajii may, among other actions provided for in these Terms, limit or suspend your access to the Email/Texting Tools.

            The Services may provide, or Users may provide, links to other Internet websites or resources. Because Faajii has no control over

            resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, services or other materials

            As part of the Services you may be able to link an account you have with a third party service, such as a social media website.
            By linking such third party account, you agree that Faajii may access, make available to and store any content that you have

            business day in Calgary, Alberta (Business Day) and the delivery was made prior to 4:30 p.m. (local time in place of receipt) and

            of each other, and neither such party will represent itself to be an agent or employee of the other. Each Organizer will pay all wages,
            salaries and other amounts due to its respective employees and will be responsible for all obligations respecting such employees

            laws of Canada applicable therein. Faajii and each User irrevocably attorns and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta
            courts situated in Calgary, Alberta and waives objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such court provides an
            inconvenient forum.</p>
        <h2>27. Rules of construction</h2>
        <p>Faajii and each User waives the application of any law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other
            document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or other document.</p>
        <h2>28. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that
            provision will be severed from these Terms and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
            that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, these Terms will be modified so as to effect
            the original intent of these Terms as closely as possible to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
            the fullest extent possible.</p>
        <h2>29. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between each party hereto with respect to the provision and use of the Services and
            all other transactions contemplated by these Terms and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
            whether oral or written, of the parties hereto. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements,
            express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the parties in connection with the subject matter of these Terms,
            except as specifically set forth in these Terms.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, each User acknowledges that Faajii may, instead of providing Services pursuant to these Terms,
            provide Services to organizers, producers, promoters, presenters, owners and managers of Events pursuant to a Client Service
            and Ticketing Agreement between Faajii and such organizer, producer, promoter, presenter, owner or manager of an Event, which
            agreement may provide for different fees to be paid to Faajii from those set out in these Terms and may provide for additional
            Services to be provided, as well as other terms and conditions which may be different from or in addition to those set out in
            these Terms. In such event, each User agrees that neither Faajii nor any such organizer, producer, promoter, presenter, owner
            or manager shall have any obligation to provide a copy of any such Client Service and Ticketing Agreement to such User; that
            each such organizer, producer, promoter, presenter, owner or manager shall be deemed to be an Organizer for the purposes of
            these Terms, and that all provisions contained in these Terms that are applicable to Patrons, shall remain in full force and effect
            with respect to any services provided by Faajii pursuant to such a Client Service and Ticketing Agreement. Under no circumstances
            shall any Patron acquire any rights as against Faajii or any Organizer that it would not otherwise have had pursuant to these Terms.
